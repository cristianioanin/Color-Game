# Color-Game
A color guessing game, based on RGB values

This game is a JavaScript project proposed by Colt Steele on his Udemy course: The Web Developer Bootcamp.
It's a fun game, where you will test you ability to recognize colors based on their RGB values.
The game looks pretty good and is straightforward, using the concepts behind DOM manipulation with only JavaScript.
